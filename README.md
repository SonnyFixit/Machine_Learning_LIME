## General info

The Titanic Survival Prediction Project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at developing a predictive model to determine the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. Leveraging historical passenger data, this project applies data preprocessing techniques, utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier for predictions, and employs the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework to interpret the model's decisions.

## Key points of the program

* Data Preprocessing
* Model Training and Evaluation
* Interpretability with LIME

## Technologies

* Python 3.11.3
* Visual Studio Code
* Seaborn and Matplotlib (for data visualization)
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* LIME (for model interpretability)
* Scikit-learn (for model training and evaluation)

## Features

* Comprehensive data preprocessing to handle missing values and convert categorical data
* Decision Tree Classifier to predict survival outcomes
* Evaluation of model performance using classification metrics and confusion matrix
* Interpretation of individual predictions with LIME
